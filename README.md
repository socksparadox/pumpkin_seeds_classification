- We took data for pumpkin seeds from Kaggle
- The data is for two categories of seeds. So the problem we are looking at is of Binary Classification.
- EDA is done and then the correlation matrix is plot.
- We try to build multiple Machine Learning models to see which model will perform the best on this type of data
- The results table in the end gives the Conclusion.
